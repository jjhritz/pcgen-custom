# Vampire Lord Template
A template geared towards PCs that offers more abilities than the base vampire template and grows in power, making the template more useful at later levels. This template may actually be extremely OP and is likely not suitable for most campaigns. Or any campaign, really.

## Adjustments
**Challenge Rating:** +3

**Senses:** Scent, Blindsight +20 ft., Darkvision 60 ft., Low-Light Vision 60 ft. If base creature has either Darkvision or Low-Light Vision, add 30 ft. to the existing distance instead.

**Size and Type:** The creatureâ€™s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. The creature's size does not change.

**Ability Scores:** +2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Cha. As an undead, a vampire does not have a Constitution score. You derive bonus HP from Charisma instead.

**Skills:** +2 Bluff, +2 Diplomacy, +2 Perception, +2 Stealth

## Special Attacks
**Fangs (Ex):** You gain a Bite natural attack dealing 1d6 damage (for a Medium creature). When you deal damage with this attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1/2 the damage you dealt. These temporary hit points stack with themselves, up to a total equal to your maximum HP. This damage is considered Magic.

**Draining Embrace (Ex):** When you have a creature Grappled or Pinned and damage it with your Fangs natural attack, you can choose to invoke this ability. When you do, you must use the Damage action each subsequent round you succesfully maintain the grapple, automatically dealing damage equal to your Fangs attack and gaining temporary HP as you would with that attack. This ability immediately ends if the target breaks free of the grapple.

**Gorging Bite (Ex):** A vampire, when trapped or impatient, can dispense with subtlety and display the true savagery of their monstrous nature. When you have a target grappled or pinned, you can invoke this ability when using the Damage action. In addition to dealing damage with your Fangs as normal, you also deal 1d4 Constitution damage and inflict Bleed equal to the amount of Constitution damage dealt. You gain HP and temporary HP equal to the sum of the damage and Constitution damage you deal with this attack. This attack cannot be combined with Draining Embrace. The trauma this attack inflicts is massive and extremely difficult to disguise or explain as anything but a vampire attack.

## Special Qualities
**Shadowless (Ex):** You cast no shadow. In a room with shadowy or better illumination, creatures gain a +5 circumstance bonus on their Knowledge (religion) checks to identify you as a vampire.

**Thirst (Ex):** A vampire is sustained by the blood of the living. Each sunrise, you must consume an amount of temporary HP gained from your Fangs attack equal to 25% of your maximum HP (rounded up). If you start the day without the requisite temporary HP, you gain the Blood-Starved special quality (see below).

**Blood-Starved (Ex):** If you have not consumed enough blood to sustain yourself, you suffer a -1 penalty on all d20 rolls and saves. These penalties stack with themselves every 3 days you go without accruing the requisite amount of feeding. These penalties are immediately removed once the vampire has and consumes enough temporary HP to slake its Thirst.

**Frenzy (Ex):** When you are below half health and take damage, you must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + damage taken) or enter Rage as a Barbarian, with the following exceptions:

  * You do not gain temporary HP from entering Frenzy.
  * You can enter Frenzy even if you are Fatigued or Exhausted, but the penalties from those conditions are halved.
  * You cannot voluntarily enter Frenzy.
  * You cannot voluntarily end a Frenzy. You must succeed on a DC 20 Will save at the start of each turn it is Frenzied or remain Frenzied.
  * You must attack the last creature to damage you. If you kill this creature before taking damage again, you instead must attack the nearest creature, regardless of if it is friend or foe.

**Light Sensitivity (Ex):** You are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

**Sunlight Weakness (Ex):** Each hour you are affected by your Light Sensitivity, you must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + hours exposed) or become fatigued (ignores immunity). If you are already fatigued, you become exhausted instead. Each time you fail this save, you also gain 1 temporary negative level. You may make saves to remove these negative levels immediately upon no longer being affected by Light Sensitivity. Any negative levels that are not removed by these saves persist as normal.

**Channel Resistance (Ex):** A vampire has Channel Resistance bonus equal to 2 + its HD.

You remain in this form until you take another standard action to regain your original form or until the next sunrise, whichever occurs first.

**Torpor (Su):** A vampire can choose to enter a deep slumber to heal their wounds and slow their bloodlust. When you use this ability, you must slumber for a number of hours equal to or greater than your HD.

While in Torpor, you are considered unconscious and must make a DC 20 Will save to voluntarily wake yourself before the appointed time; this reduces to DC 15 if you take damage. Others may wake you using the Aid Another action with a DC equal to the DC required to wake yourself.

You must remain in an area of low light or darker while in Torpor. If you would be affected by your Light Sensitivity or Sunlight Weakness, your healing stops, you do not wake automatically at the appointed time, and any tests made to rouse yourself or resist your Sunlight Weakness are made at a -4 penalty. If the conditions that would cause you to be affected by your Light Sensitivity or Sunlight Weakness end, and the appointed time for you to awaken has passed, you wake automatically as normal.
