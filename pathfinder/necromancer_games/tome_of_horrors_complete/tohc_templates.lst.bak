### Dire Animal: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/dire-creature-cr-2-tohc/
## STAT ADJUSTMENTS
#	CR:	 2
#	Size and Type:	If base creature is Tiny or smaller, increase to Small. Otherwise, increase its size by one size category. 
#					The dire creature DOES NOT gain the benefits or penalties to ability scores that arise from increased size.
#	AC:	+5 Natural Armor.  Stacks with existing natural armor.
#	HD:	If size is Small, +1 HD (Min. 2)
#		If size is Medium, +3 HD (Min. 4)
#		If size is Large or Larger, double HD (Min. 6)
#		Recalculate base attack bonus and base saves according to the dire creatureâ€™s new Hit Dice total 
#		(base attack bonus equals 3/4 Hit Dice, Fort and Ref equal 1/2 Hit Dice +2, Will equals 1/3 Hit Dice).
#	Speed:	+10 ft.
#	Attacks:	Adjust natural and special attacks to new size, per Natural Attack progression table
#	Abilities:	Str +8, Dex +2, Con +8, Wis +4, Cha +4
#	Feats: 	Same as base creature, with additional feats gained through the usual means from the increase in HD.
#			If the base animal has Weapon Finesse and the feat would become useless after its increase in Strength, then it may trade Weapon Finesse for Weapon Focus with one of its natural attacks.
#	Skills: A dire creature gains skill points equal to 2 + Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) for each HD it gained. Its class skills are unchanged.
