# Pathfinder Homebrew
Assorted homebrew content I cook up as needed for characters.

## Here there be monsters
I make no guarantees these are at all balanced or suited for blind play. Almost all of them are made to suit one particular character in one particular campaign, so they may not even work for most campaigns.

## Contents
### Ex-Elder Mythos Cultist
Applies ex-class principles to the Elder Mythos Cultist archetype for Cleric. Removes Channel the Void and Maddening Gaze so the Cleric can take any other archetype they wish. Made for an EMC cleric who converted away from the Elder Gods. 

### Paladin of Erastil
A Paladin archetype designed for followers of the God of Hunters and doesn't suck as much as the Divine Hunter archetype (seriously, it absolutely blows). Extra skill points per level and class skills, a bit better in ranged combat, and loses Heavy Armor and Shield proficiencies in exchange for dodge bonuses to AC and proficiencies in nets and bolas. Made for a character whose job is more like that of a Witcher than a Crusader.

### Vampire Lord
A more powerful version of the Vampire PC template by Dreamscarred Press. Grants more abilities, spread out across 20 levels, including but not limited to: healing from feeding, temporary Ability Score buffs, VtM-style Frenzy and Torpor, scaling blood drinking damage, turning into a cloud of bats, Haste, Dominate, Fast Healing, and auras of Animate Dead and life steal. I don't expect this to be balanced in the slightest. Use with caution. Made for a character who should be a kickass ancient vampire.

This also serves as an experiment to see how Gestalt classes could be jury-rigged into PCGen.
